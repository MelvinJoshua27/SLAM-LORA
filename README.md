# Ultra6 Obstacle Mapping System ‚Äì VB6 + LoRa

This project demonstrates a **real-time obstacle detection and mapping system** built using **Visual Basic 6 (VB6)**. It receives data from external sensors (e.g., ultrasonic modules) via **LoRa wireless communication** and displays obstacles in an AR-style graphical interface.

Originally developed as a low-cost SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) prototype, this system helps visualize environmental boundaries based on distance measurements.
